/*
Problem: 401. Binary Watch

A binary watch has 4 LEDs for hours (0-11) and 6 LEDs for minutes (0-59). 
Each LED represents a binary digit (1 = on, 0 = off). 

Given an integer turnedOn representing the number of LEDs currently on, 
return all possible times the watch could represent.

Output format:
- "H:MM" (hours without leading zeros, minutes always 2 digits)

Example:
Input: turnedOn = 1
Output: ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32",
         "1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]

Approach:
1. Iterate through all possible hours (0-11) and minutes (0-59).
2. Count the number of 1 bits using __builtin_popcount.
3. If the total equals turnedOn, add formatted time string to result.

Time Complexity: O(12*60) = O(720) â‰ˆ O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1) extra (apart from result vector)
